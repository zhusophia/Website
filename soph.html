            <h4>I’ve wanted to create a personal website for the longest time. I'd put off starting a full website for a multitude of <s>reasons</s> excuses though. I couldn’t settle on a design, got too busy with school work, had other priorities. But, if you’re seeing this website, clearly I’ve sat down and just… did it! </h4>
            <h4>I’ve had a <strong>lot of design iterations</strong>, meaning there's a ton of  Figma prototypes left half complete. This is actually <a style="color: black"href="https://www.figma.com/file/Tj6M6Do1nnpGe4AK9OuWHq/Website-Draft-2?type=design&t=RLWWIeMmWRubAptu-1" target="\blank">Website Prototype V3</a>. For the longest time, I wanted to make it completely black and white, and have my name written vertically on every page (see above). If you're sharp, you can tell it's pretty old because I was still choosing between university programs, which is why I had engineering on the home page. But, looking at my friend's Waterloo Engineering schedule (it's PACKED), I'm hesitant regret my decision >:)</h4>
            <h4>For <a style="color: black"href="https://www.figma.com/file/LkVeUyB197r02KichiMEYS/Personal-Website-Prototype?type=design&node-id=0%3A1&t=Gd0wKhWJaB8lmcZt-1" target="\blank">SophLand V1</a>, I thought it looked so cool, but <strong>I don’t think it's representative</strong> of my actual personality. So, I spent a year looking over other websites and gathering inspiration, and ended up with this! It’s a little bit softer than my original idea, no? </h4>
            <h4>The only thing that has been consistent throughout my designs is having <strong>interactive components</strong>, where users would need to click text to reveal more text. I thought it would be so cool to force users to click and think to reveal something hidden! Originally, I wanted to use it for a scavenger hunt, where I would hide code words (my core values - curiosity, vivacity and flexibility) for users to find. The interactive part would’ve been the instructions to find and input the code words, with the reward being some cool video I’d edit together. Clearly, it didn’t end up happening. <strong>Or did it…?</strong> </h4>
            <h4>Looking now, the V1 prototype had a lot more popups to encourage interactivity and more humour. <strong>Even now, I'm thinking "wow that's so cool!"</strong> However, I <strong>don't think it'd fit the current style</strong> of this website. In the future, I definitely want to build another website (no specific theme, maybe one to show off some kind of data) utilizing more interactive elements and containing more humor. A funny academic investigation, if you will.  </h4>
            <h4><strong>I’m really proud of what I’ve built</strong>. It’s very similar to how I imagined it to be, so I’m super happy about that, even if there are some things I had to compromise on. Regardless, even if it didn’t live up to my full expectations, it’s something. Something that I told myself I’d do, and finally completed. Knowing that I actually took the time to complete it makes me far happier than you could probably imagine. </h4>
