            <h4><strong>Pog Networks (Pog)</strong> helps  streamers connect through 50+ weekly online events - a project we started amid the pandemic, when everybody was confined to their rooms. </h4>
            <h4>Our thought process was: 
                
            <ol>
                <li>People are lonely. </li>
                <li>Lonely people flocked to <a style="color: black"href="https://www.twitch.tv" target="\blank">Twitch</a> (a live-streaming platform) to share their hobbies and get a taste of sweet <i>sweet</i> social interaction.</li>
                <li>Twitch became oversaturated.</li>
                <li>Many smaller Twitch channels had <a style="color: black"href="https://www.dexerto.com/entertainment/new-twitch-stats-reveal-how-few-viewers-are-needed-to-be-a-top-streamer-1527638/" target="\blank">less than 5 viewers</a>, many who ‘lurked’ and didn’t send messages to chat with the live-streamer. The streamer's loneliness remains.</li>
                <li>Streamers find it difficult to attract more viewers or find friends on the platform. During this time, their sense of isolation may compound and they may give up on streaming.</li>
                <li>Repeat steps 2 to 5.</li>
            </ol>
</h4>
            <h4><b>Step 5 is where Pog stepped in.</b> We wanted to allow streamers to connect in a (relatively) organic manner, while also introducing their viewers to another streamer! This could lead to a great friendship and expose viewers to somebody new! </h4>
            <h4>So, our genius idea was to host weekly gaming competitions because: 
                <ol>
                
                <li>We could split streamers into pairs, allowing for one-on-one bonding.</li>
                <li>Conversations wouldn’t be as awkward, since they’d be playing their favorite game and could discuss potential strategies.</li>
                <li>Events lasted for 2 to 3 hours, ensuring there was plenty of time to chat.</li>
                </ol>
                </h4>
            <h4>Hosting tournaments wasn’t easy. <b>Our first tournament kinda sucked</b> because nothing was efficient and we made so many mistakes. But, over time, we got a lot better! We built a match-making system by taking a streamer’s skill and preferences into consideration when choosing teams. We started broadcasting games to allow streamers to commentate with when they weren’t playing. We even expanded our team and trained social media managers to help us with marketing!</h4>
                
            <h4>In the end, we closed Pog because our operations became too time-consuming (everything was super manual). This became difficult to balance alongside our academics. However, I’ve learnt so many things as we’ve progressed, and I’m honored to see Pog through until the end. </h4>
