        <h4><strong>Adelia Elle (Adelia) is a skincare e-commerce</strong>, selling luxurious and sustainable beauty tech. It was the first official job I have ever had, and I remember being ecstatic when I got the job!</h4>
        <h4>Working at Adelia has definitely shaped a lot of my work preferences. For example, <strong>my desire for varied tasks, as well as my independent work style. </strong>This is because Adelia was a small company (it was just the CEO and I), so it meant that I was able to try out every role and wore lots of hats! Furthermore, I was typically given vague instructions and was told to do what I saw fit. This environment resulted in high-impact work coupled with lots of freedom and responsibility—the perfect trio. </h4>

                    <h3>December 2020: Social Media</h3>
                    <h5>Every single day, I would engage as many accounts on  <a style="color: black"href="https://instagram.com/adelia_elle" target="\blank">Instagram</a> as possible, trying to establish ourselves within the industry. I learned the art of writing Instagram comments, building hashtag sets, and planning our profile—nothing would be left behind</h5>

                    <h3>March 2021: Brand Ambassadors</h3>
                    <h5>I decided to start a brand ambassador campaign to promote the launch of our newest product! I reached out to influencers with similar audiences, drafted a contract, and built an <a style="color: black"href="https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1hfuXMKCkS_vwsN8xpGWOst-NScVMvTSW?usp=sharing" target="\blank">Influencer Kit</a> for photo inspiration and to communicate our values! Alongside that, I managed our monthly emails, building templates to give subscribers secret coupons and behind-the-scenes to our photo shoots. Truly the peak of customer relationship management.</h5>

                    <h3>May 2021: Facebook Ads </h3>
                    <h5>I was given a chance to experience using <a style="color: black"href="https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/11TybvV2gkj83IU5uLGqSCdnn_VPuhvrH?usp=sharing" target="\blank">Facebook Ads </a>to market our products. It was here where I learned how to “understand data”—the most important lesson. I spent hours researching “best practices” and analyzing trends to see which Facebook Ads work best. Analyzing results after the promotion period. Iterating on designs to marginally improve performance.                     </h5>
                    <h5>I always ended each week presenting my findings to the CEO and discussing what I should do in the future. My weekly experiments are something I look back on fondly; Data is so fun to play with :)                    </h5>
