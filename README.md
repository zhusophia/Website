# Welcome to SophLand (zhusophia.github.io)

Creating a personal website! Always planned to do this, and I'm finally excited to get the time to do so. It's also my first project utilziing purely HTML, CSS and JS. <br>
I really wanted to include interactive elements, to force the viewer to actually... do stuff. I think it makes it more fun. I also don't really like 'scrolling' websites, 
where the user keeps scrolling down linearly. I do incorporate it in one of the subpages, but I was adamant on not making the entire website like that. <br>
I think there's a lot of stuff I wish I could've implemented, but couldn't due to technical constraints: 
- Blender animation with a ticket to transition from the interactive -> main page 
- Making an improved background for the main page, which isn't as 'random' (but it's still a part I really like) 
- Page transitions <br>
Overall, it still was a great experience and I learnt TONS (that hamburger menu took *far* too long to debug. <br>
Enjoy SophLand!
