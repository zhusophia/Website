            <h4><strong>Pog Networks</strong> helps Twitch streamers connect through <b>50+ weekly online competitions</b> and socials.</h4>
            <h4>My friends and I started Pog Networks in the midst of the pandemic, when isolation was at its highest. During this time, we realized that many flocked to live-streaming services such as <a style="color: black"href="https://www.twitch.tv" target="\blank">Twitch</a> to meet people and play games with others. 
                However, these streamers’ aspirations were <b>quickly destroyed</b>, as many struggled to meet other streamers and had to <a style="color: black"href="https://inthirdperson.com/2020/09/10/some-twitch-stats-to-put-your-streaming-ambitions-into-perspective/" target="\blank">compete for viewers</a>. The connection they longed for and the communities they wanted to build… <b>didn’t exist?</b></h4>
            <h4>That’s where Pog steps in. We’re here to <strong>make this process easier for streamers</strong> as we pair them up in duos and host 3-hour long events to build connections--all while streamers chilling with their chat and playing their favourite game!</h4>
            <h4><strong>It wasn’t easy.</strong> Our first tournament was <i>rough</i>. Nothing was efficient and we made so many mistakes. But overtime, we got a lot better! We <strong>built a match-making system</strong>, taking a streamer’s skill, preferences, profanity and more into considerations when choosing teams! We started streaming ourselves to <strong>give streamers opportunities</strong> to commentate when they weren’t playing. We even <strong>expanded our team</strong> and trained social media managers to help us with marketing!</h4>
            <h4>Ultimately, we closed because our operations became too manual and took a lot of time away from our academics. However, I’ve learnt so much as I juggled dozens of hats while building Pog up from scratch. </h4>
