            <h4> <strong>Asian Wander Women (AWW)</strong> is a 1700+ member <a style="color: black"href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/asianwanderwomen" target="\blank">Facebook community</a> turned media company which aims to support and inspirate female digital nomads. </h4>
            <h4> I joined AWW because digital nomadism is something that interests me–the idea of having more flexibility while traveling the world draws me in! Hence, I was super excited when I got an opportunity to meet more people with similar mindsets, so I could see how being a digital nomad changed their life and whether it was right for me.  </h4>
            <h4>Although It’s not a lifestyle I plan to pursue in the near future, I stayed in the community because I'm drawn to the members. All these women are passionately chasing their dreams while supporting and inspiring each other. Their ability to <strong>stay authentic</strong> and <strong>dare-to-dream attitude</strong> are things that continuously inspire me and my actions.</h4>

                        <h3>February 2022: Social Media Manager</h3>
                        <h5>I started as AWW's social media manager. I primarily focused on growing <a style="color: black"href="https://www.instagram.com/asianwanderwomenco/" target="\blank">AWW's Instagram</a>  and moderating the Facebook community. </h5>
                        <h5>For Instagram, I wanted to test out the strategy of “posting every day and surely I’ll beat the algorithm” to moderate success. I ended up getting a few viral reels and celebrities such as Lexie Liu interacting with our stories–pinch me!</h5>
                        <h5>Within the Facebook community, I focused on engagement and unifying our community through various activities (ex. AWW’s Shared Spotify Playlist and our private job board). This later grew into building our Discord community, as we wanted to foster longer and more casual conversations between members.</h5>

                        <h3>April 2022: Buildathon Event Lead</h3>
                        <h5>During the summer, I focused on leading AWW’s inaugural buildathon. It was so rewarding to oversee the entire event, as it started from a tiny idea and grew into a 3-day event!</h5>
                        <h5>In this role, there were a ton of tasks I was responsible for, from ideating, cold-emailing sponsors, leading team meetings, organizing workshops, and assisting with mock-ups. However, my favorite part was undoubtedly hosting an in-person meeting up in Toronto! It was so amazing to see the lovely women in our community while grabbing coffee!                        </h5>

                        <h3>September 2022: Content Lead</h3>
                        <h5>As AWW shifted to a media company, I managed our <a style="color: black"href="https://www.asianwanderwomen.com/aww-spotlight" target="\blank">AWW Spotlight series</a>, interviewing the women in our community. Every person I interviewed had different perspectives on travel, work, and digital nomadism. It was fascinating to see how experiences and values shaped a person and their definition of success. I really wish them all the best :) </h5>
