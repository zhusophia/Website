            <h4><strong>Asian Wander Women (AWW)</strong> is a 1700+ member <a style="color: black"href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/asianwanderwomen" target="\blank">Facebook community</a> (turned media company) that aims to connect and inspire female digital nomads. </h4>
            <h4>I joined AWW because digital nomadism is something I find interesting - who doesn’t like the idea of escaping the 9 to 5? I dreamt of flying away from my suburban monotony to exotic locales, where I would truly understand world freedom. <strong>However, that’s a very… romanticized view of nomadism.</strong> In reality, it’s difficult: you still have long work hours, you’re smothered with a blanket of loneliness, and uncertainty lies in every corner. </h4>          
            <h4>Of course, it was naive of me to think that being a digital nomad would solve all my problems. The lifestyle just replaced my current problems with new problems. So, I backed away from the nomadic lifestyle, burying my dreams and saving them for later. </h4>
            <h4>However, the women in AWW did the opposite. They dived in, embracing their passion for freedom and running toward their dreams. They quit their stable job, put everything in a suitcase, and just… left. </h4>            
            <h4>Every time I engage with the community, <strong>I am left in awe</strong>. Their passion inspires me. Their ability to stay authentic and their dare-to-dream attitude inspires me. The bond they have and their unending support for each other inspire me. </h4>       
            <h4>AWW inspires me to be the best that I can be, and I’m incredibly glad that I found this community. </h4>

                        <h3>February 2022: Social Media Manager</h3>
                        <h5>I started as AWW's social media manager. I primarily focused on growing <a style="color: black"href="https://www.instagram.com/asianwanderwomenco/" target="\blank">AWW's Instagram</a>  and moderating the Facebook community. </h5>
                        <h5>For Instagram, I wanted to test out the strategy of “posting every day and surely I’ll beat the algorithm” to moderate success. I ended up getting a few viral reels and celebrities such as Lexie Liu interacting with our stories–pinch me!</h5>
                        <h5>Within the Facebook community, I focused on engagement and unifying our community through various activities (ex. AWW’s Shared Spotify Playlist and our private job board). This later grew into building our Discord community, as we wanted to foster longer and more casual conversations between members.</h5>

                        <h3>April 2022: Buildathon Event Lead</h3>
                        <h5>During the summer, I focused on leading AWW’s inaugural buildathon. It was so rewarding to oversee the entire event, as it started from a tiny idea and grew into a 3-day event!</h5>
                        <h5>In this role, there were a ton of tasks I was responsible for, from ideating, cold-emailing sponsors, leading team meetings, organizing workshops, and assisting with mock-ups. However, my favorite part was undoubtedly hosting an in-person meeting up in Toronto! It was so amazing to see the lovely women in our community while grabbing coffee!                        </h5>

                        <h3>September 2022: Content Lead</h3>
                        <h5>As AWW shifted to a media company, I managed our <a style="color: black"href="https://www.asianwanderwomen.com/aww-spotlight" target="\blank">AWW Spotlight series</a>, interviewing the women in our community. Every person I interviewed had different perspectives on travel, work, and digital nomadism. It was fascinating to see how experiences and values shaped a person and their definition of success. I really wish them all the best :) </h5>

                        <h5>I’m now working on AWW’s 2024 Summit. It’s a week-long event for nomadic creators and entrepreneurs to help them “create a meaningful life and wander on their own terms.” It’s still in the works, and I can’t wait to see the results!</h5>
